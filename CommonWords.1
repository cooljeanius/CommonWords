The name "input.dat" is hard-coded, so this program can't operate on any other files.

The length of the input file is also hard-coded due to faulty EOF handling, so using a file that is longer can result in an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error, and using a file that is shorter can result in junk data being appended to the end of the results.

The structure of the input file is assumed to be the same as the provided input.dat file, so if this program is used on files structured in any other way, it will most likely produce incorrect results.
